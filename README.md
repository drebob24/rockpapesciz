A simple game of rock-paper-scissors

The goal of this project is to create a browser based rock-paper-scissors game to be played against a computer.

At first a simple console based game will be designed, then later a GUI will be added.

The overall goal is to practice javascript and logically planning out a a task and the functions needed to complete that task.
